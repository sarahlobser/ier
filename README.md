Node E-Commerce project

For this project we created a public-facing website for an imaginary company. We created a database filled with artificial
data that was read in from a csv file. The database contains a User table, a (shopping) Cart table, and 
a Product table. The project also utilizes cookies and sessions. The site has three levels of access depending on whether
the user is an employee, guest, or customer with an account.

Technologies used:
-- node JS
-- express
-- handlebars
-- mysql
-- sequelize
-- heroku
-- passport
-- bcrypt
